Any revisions that we make to these statistics will be made in line with our [Revisions and Corrections policy.](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/policies-and-procedures) Any significant errors that are identified within these statistics after their publication that would result in the contradiction of conclusions previously drawn from the data will be notified of prominently on our website and any other platforms that host these statistics, corrected as soon as possible, and communicated clearly to users and stakeholders.

### 7. Quality of the statistics

We aim to provide users of this publication with an evidence-based assessment of its quality and the quality of the data from which it is produced. We do so to demonstrate our commitment to comply with the UK Statistics Authority’s (UKSA) Code of Practice for Statistics, particularly the pillar of Quality and its principles.

**Q1 Suitable data sources** – Statistics should be based on the most appropriate data to meet intended uses. The impact of any data limitations for use should be assessed, minimised, and explained.

**Q2 Sound methods** – Producers of statistics and data should use the best available methods and recognised standards and be open about their decisions.

**Q3 Assured quality** – Producers of statistics and data should explain clearly how they assure themselves that statistics and data are accurate, reliable, coherent, and timely.

This is an assessment of the quality of these statistics against the European standard for quality reporting and its dimensions specific to statistical outputs, particularly:

*	Relevance
*	Accuracy and reliability
* Timeliness and punctuality
*	Accessibility
*	Coherence and comparability

These principles guide us and are complimented by the UKSA’s regulatory standard for the Quality Assurance of Administrative Data (QAAD). You can view our QAAD assessment of prescription data [on our website.](https://www.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/statistical-collections)


#### 7.1. Relevance

*This dimension covers the degree to which the product meets user need in both coverage and content*

#### 7.2. Accuracy and Reliability

*This dimension covers the statistics proximity between an estimate and the unknown true value*

#### 7.3. Timeliness and punctuality

*Timeliness refers to the time gap between publication and the reference period. Punctuality refers to the gap between planned and actual publication dates*

#### 7.4. Accessibility and clarity

*Accessibility is the ease with which users can access the data, also reflecting the format in which the data are available and the availability of supporting information. Clarity refers to the quality and sufficiency of the metadata, illustrations, and accompanying advice*

##### **7.4.1. Accessibility**

##### **7.4.1. Clarity**

#### 7.5. Coherence and comparability

*Coherence is the degree to which data have been derived from different sources or methods but refer to the same topic or similar. Comparability is the degree to which data can be compared over time and domain*

##### **7.5.1. Comparisons over time**

**Trade-offs between output quality components**

*This dimension describes the extent to which different aspects of quality are balanced against each other*

**Assessment of user needs and perceptions**

*This dimension covers the processes for finding out about users and uses and their views on the statistical products*

**Confidentiality, transparency and security**

*The procedures and policy used to ensure sound confidentiality, security and transparent practices*

**Quality assurance of administrative data**
